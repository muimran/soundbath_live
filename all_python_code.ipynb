    "Here are all the codes that have been used to access the API for English, Scottish, and Welsh rainfall, in order to retrieve station ID, coordinates, and rainfall amount. This data is then recorded in a CSV file. Additionally, the county name is extracted based on the coordinates using the OpenCage package. The code also averages out the rainfall amount for each county in a separate column. This page also contains a sort of evolutionary history of the code, detailing how it developed over time into the final version that performs all these tasks."
